entities.KoseiHelper/ClimbJumpController.attributes.description.staminaSpent=The stamina that a climbjump will spend.\nIn vanilla, the player has normally 110 max stamina, and each climbjump spends 27.5.\nThis field does not alter the stamina refunded by wallboosts (27.5).\nValues <27.5 will allow players to "farm" stamina through wallboosts.
entities.KoseiHelper/ClimbJumpController.attributes.description.wallBoostTimer=If the player looks away from the wall after a climbjump, they will recover 27.5 stamina.\nThis is known as a wallboost.

entities.KoseiHelper/ClimbJumpController.attributes.description.wallBoostStaminaRefund=How much stamina the player would get back after performing a wallboost.\nRead the wallboost timer tooltip for a wallboost explanation.\nValues >27.5 will make the player unable to regain stamina if they have more than 110 minus this value.\nFor example, setting the refund to 50 means that stamina will be refunded from a wallboost if it is below 60.
entities.KoseiHelper/ClimbJumpController.attributes.description.horizontalSpeedMultiplier=Multiplies the horizontal speed that climbjumps give (while a direction is being held).\nIt also affects speed in techs derived from climbjumps, like cornerboosts.

# Procedural Generator Trigger
# triggers.KoseiHelper/ProceduralGeneratorTrigger.placements.name.ProceduralGeneratorTrigger=Procedural Generator Trigger
# triggers.KoseiHelper/ProceduralGeneratorTrigger.placements.description.ProceduralGeneratorTrigger=Outputs randomized tiles in the console when entered.
# triggers.KoseiHelper/ProceduralGeneratorTrigger.attributes.description.density=Controls the probability of placing a tile when noise exceeds the threshold (higher = more tiles).
# triggers.KoseiHelper/ProceduralGeneratorTrigger.attributes.description.noiseScale=Sets the base frequency of the Perlin noise (lower = larger, smoother structures).
# triggers.KoseiHelper/ProceduralGeneratorTrigger.attributes.description.noiseThreshold=Minimum noise value required to consider placing a tile.
# triggers.KoseiHelper/ProceduralGeneratorTrigger.attributes.description.octaves=Number of layers of noise used for detail (higher = more detailed noise).
# triggers.KoseiHelper/ProceduralGeneratorTrigger.attributes.description.persistence=How much each successive octave contributes to the overall noise (lower = smoother).
# triggers.KoseiHelper/ProceduralGeneratorTrigger.attributes.description.lacunarity=How much the frequency increases with each octave (lower = less variation/detail).
# triggers.KoseiHelper/ProceduralGeneratorTrigger.attributes.description.sizeX=Width of the area to apply the procedural generation.
# triggers.KoseiHelper/ProceduralGeneratorTrigger.attributes.description.sizeY=Height of the area to apply the procedural generation.
# triggers.KoseiHelper/ProceduralGeneratorTrigger.attributes.description.tileChars=string of tileset ids to randomly select from when placing new tiles.

triggers.KoseiHelper/MultinodeCameraTrigger.placements.description.MultinodeCameraTrigger=The camera will lerp smoothly between the nodes closest to the player.
triggers.KoseiHelper/MultinodeCameraTrigger.attributes.description.onlyOnce=Whether the trigger should disappear upon exiting it.
triggers.KoseiHelper/MultinodeCameraTrigger.attributes.description.flag=The trigger will only update the camera while the flag is true.\nLeave empty for no flag required.
triggers.KoseiHelper/MultinodeCameraTrigger.attributes.description.lerpStrength=How much the camera should lerp between the nodes and the player with the current offset.\nIn other words, the effectiveness of the trigger.
triggers.KoseiHelper/MultinodeCameraTrigger.attributes.description.xOnly=Whether the trigger should only smoothly lerp in the horizontal axis.
triggers.KoseiHelper/MultinodeCameraTrigger.attributes.description.yOnly=Whether the trigger should only smoothly lerp in the vertical axis.
triggers.KoseiHelper/MultinodeCameraTrigger.attributes.description.smoothingStrength=The intensity of the smoothing effect.
triggers.KoseiHelper/MultinodeCameraTrigger.attributes.description.maxSmoothingDistance=The nodes that are more than this distance away from the player will be ignored.
